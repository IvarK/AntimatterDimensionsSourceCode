    You have reached the limits of reality and cannot hold more than {{ format(capRM) }} Reality Machines.
    <br>
    Machines gained in excess of {{ format(baseRMCap) }} will raise the maximum amount of Imaginary Machines
    you can have.
    <br>
    Imaginary Machines are gained passively over time up to the cap, but gain slows down exponentially
    as you approach the cap.
    <br>
    Every {{ formatInt(scaleTime) }} seconds the difference in iM between your current amount and the cap
    will be cut in half.
    <br>
    <br>
    The first two rows of upgrades can be purchased endlessly and the rest of the upgrades are one-time upgrades
    <br>
    which have an unlocking requirement in addition to costing Imaginary Machines.
    <br>
    The visual behavior of these upgrades is identical to upgrades in the Reality Upgrades tab.
