// The glyphTypes entry is used for both gameplay and cosmetics purposes, so we cannot modify isUnlocked for cosmetics.
// For the purposes of cosmetics, the difference between isUnlocked and canCustomize is as follows:
// - isUnlocked: Whether or not this type appears as a choice in glyph-specific customization for overriding their
//    normal display type; this is ignored for functional type entries
// - canCustomize: Whether or not this type can have its color/symbol changed in the type-specific customization
