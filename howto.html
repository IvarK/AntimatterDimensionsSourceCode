  <b>Dimensions:</b>
  <br>
  Dimensions are your production units in game.  The first Dimension produces your Antimatter.  Each consecutive dimension produces the previous one, allowing you to have steady growth. There are eight dimensions total. <br>
  <b>Dimension Multiplier:</b> Beside the dimension there is a multiplier (example: First Dimension x1.0). The base production of each dimension is multiplied by this number.  This multiplier increases by 2x(Base) for every 10 of that dimension purchased. Each time this occurs, the price of the dimension will increase. <br>
  <b>Accumulated Dimension Quantity:</b> The next column is your current amount of that dimension you own. This is a combination of how many you have purchased with antimatter, as well as produced from the higher dimension. <br>
  <b>Purchased Dimensions Quantity:</b>  Next to each accumulated quantity of owned dimensions, the amount of that dimension purchased toward the next multiplier upgrade is displayed in brackets.  If you have (4) next to your accumulated dimension quaintly, you will need 6 more of that dimension for the next multiplier increase. <br>
  <b>Dimension Growth Percent:</b>  This number represents the amount of growth that dimensions experiences per second. +100% means the dimension is doubling each second.  This allows you to judge overall growth. <br>
  <b>Cost & until 10:</b> You can buy a single quantity of each dimension with antimatter when the cost button is highlighted.  Alternatively, if the Until 10 buttons is highlighted, you can buy whatever quantity gets you to that dimensions next dimension multiplier. <br>
  <b>Max all:</b> Max all will buy max tickspeed (see below), then will buy until 10 of 1st dimension until it can't anymore, then 2nd, and so on. <br>
  <b>Dimension base prices:</b> 10, 100, 10000, 1e6, 1e9, 1e13, 1e18, 1e24 <br>
  <b>Base per 10 bought dimension price increases:</b>1000, 10000, 1e5, 1e6, 1e8, 1e10, 1e12, 1e15 <br>
  <b>Hotkeys: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</b> for buy until 10 []th dimension, <b>M</b> for Max all

  <button onclick='changestate(2)' id='div2btn' class="storebtn">Ticks</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div2' class='hidden'>
  <b>Tick:</b> Production in the game happens on each “tick”. <br>
  <b>Interval:</b> The length of time between ticks. This is lowered by purchasing tick interval reductions. <br>
  <b>Cost:</b> The cost of antimatter for reducing the tick interval by the % displayed above (Without Galaxies your base tickspeed decrease is 11% per purchase) <br>
  <b>Buy Max:</b> This will buy the maximum amount of tick interval decreases available with your current amount of Antimatter. <br>
  Note that the actual tickspeed time is fake and the game always runs at 20 ticks per second.

  <button onclick='changestate(3)' id='div3btn' class="storebtn">Dimension Shift/Boost</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div3' class='hidden'>
  <b>Dimension Shift:</b> This resets your current game, but unlocks another dimension for your next run. Each one requires 20 (base) of your highest unlocked dimension. <br>
  <b>Dimension Boost:</b> A dimension shift, but you don't unlock a new dimension. This happens after 4 dimension shifts. Each one requires 20+(boosts*15) (base) eighth dimensions. <br>
  Each dimension shift and boost will provide a x2 (base) multiplier to first dimension, and each dimension after will have half (base) multiplier as the previous (min 1). <br>
  <b>Hotkey: D</b>

  <hr id='div3hr'>
  <button onclick='changestate(4)' id='div4btn' class="storebtn">Antimatter Galaxies</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div4' class='hidden'>
  Purchasing an Antimatter Galaxy will reset your game back to the point where only 4 Dimensions are available, but will increase the effect of your tick speed interval reduction by 2%. <br>
  Though it will have very little impact for the first few purchases, the increase is multiplicative and won’t take long to be visible. <br>
  Your first galaxy will increase your tickspeed interval upgrade as if it were 10% originally, so you will have 12% after 1 galaxy. <br>
  Galaxies require 80+(galaxies*60) (base) Eighth Dimensions. (80+galaxies*60+(galaxies-99)^2*2 when above 100 non-replicanti galaxies) <br>
    <b>Hotkey: G</b>

  <hr id='div4hr'>
  <button onclick='changestate(5)' id='div5btn' class="storebtn">Dimensional Sacrifice</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div5' class='hidden'>
  You unlock Dimensional Sacrifice after your first dimension boost. <br>
  Sacrificing will immediately reduce the owned quantity of dimensions 1 through 7 to zero. This does not reduce the multiplier or the current cost.  In return, it will multiply the Eighth Dimension Multiplier by the shown value. It will take time to get back to the production you previously had, but you will end up with a net increase. <br>
  <b>When should I Sacrifice?</b> Depends on your percentages (+%/s), but if they are over ~2% and the multiplier is over 2x, I'd say it's worth it. The lower the percentage, the longer it takes to gain back your dimensions. <br>
  <b>Dimensional Sacrifice Checkbox:</b> This allows you to complete dimensional sacrifices without having the warning popup. <br><br>
  The dimensional sacrifice formula (where n is the total amount of first dimensions you've had) is: <br>
  Base: (log(n)/10)^m, where m is 2 at base, 2.2 with the "The Gods are pleased" achievement, and 2.5 with the "Gift from the Gods" achievement. <br>
  Eighth Dimension Autobuyer Challenge: m^0.05/n^0.04*j, where m is the current number of first dimensions you have and j is your previous sacrifice multiplier. <br>
  After Infinity Challenge 2: n^m, where m is 0.01 at base and 0.011 with the "Yet another infinity reference" achievement. <br>

  Once you have too much Antimatter for the world to handle (2^1024, or 1.7976931348623159e308) you’ll reach infinity and be able to perform a “Big Crunch”. <br>
  Each Infinity completed will give an Infinity Point. These can be spent on upgrades in the new infinity tab. You must purchase these upgrades from top to bottom. <br>
  The "x2 IP from all sources" upgrade can be bought multiple times, but each purchase requires 10 times as much IP. You must buy all 16 previous infinity upgrades to buy the first level. <br>
  <b>When should I try to reach Infinity?</b> It's recommend to get 2 galaxies before attempting to reach it. On the way there, you should dimension boost as many times as you can.

  <hr id='div6hr'>
  <button onclick='changestate(7)' id='div7btn' class="storebtn">Achievements</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div7' class='hidden'>
  Each achievement has conditions that must be met before they are earned.  Some are very simple, and some are significantly trickier.  You may have to infinity or start a challenge before attempting some of the harder ones. <br>
  You will recieve a x1.5 multiplier to all dimensions for each completed row. In addition, some achievements have their own rewards.

  <hr id='div7hr'>
  <button onclick='changestate(8)' id='div8btn' class="storebtn">Challenges</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div8' class='hidden'>
  Challenges are unlocked after first infinity; they change in-game mechanics in different ways to create more difficult infinity circumstances. <br>
  Each completed challenge will award an auto buyer.  You can run them multiple times (though only the first time grants a reward), and they can be exited at any time via the “Exit Challenge” button on the challenge tab. <br>
  The rightmost row of Infinity Upgrades does not work in challenges.

  <button onclick='changestate(9)' id='div9btn' class="storebtn">Autobuyers</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div9' class='hidden'>
  <b>Autobuyers:</b>
  <br>
  Autobuyers (awarded by completing challenges) allow the automatic purchase of dimensions, dimension shifts/boosts, galaxies, tickspeed interval decreases, Big Crunches, and Dimensional Sacrifice (later). They are located under the infinty tab in "Autobuyers". <br><br>
  <b>Priority:</b> Priorities tell the game which autobuyer will buy if two are affordable in the same tick. Priority 1 is bought 1st, Priority 2 is bought 2nd, etc. Two equal priorities will pick their buying order randomly. <!-- While you cannot set these, big crunch has a priority of 0, galaxies have a priority of 10, dimboosts 11, and sacrifice (once unlocked) 11. --> <br>
  <b>Autobuyer Speed:</b>The cooloff period before the autobuyer makes another puchase. This rounds up to the nearest 100ms, so 200ms and 101ms are the same speed. <br>
  <b>Bulk Buy:</b> Once the Speed of an Autobuyer is maxed, all future upgrades will double the amount the autobuyer purchases per tick. This can be disabled. <br>
  <b>Dimension Autobuyer Buy Quantity:</b> Autobuyers for dimensions can be set to buy a single, or until 10, on each cooldown. Bulk buy does not work when the autobuyer is set to singles. <br>
  <b>Tickspeed Autobuyer Buy Quantity:</b> The tickspeed autobuyer can be set to buy a single or the max available on each cooldown. <br>
  <b>Automatic Dimboost Customization:</b> With the Dimboost autobuyer you can set the max amount of 8th dimensions to use for the autobuyer, the amount of galaxies before dimboosts are always autopurchased, and (when unlocked) the ability to buy dimboosts in bulk (at a fixed amount). <br>
  <b>Max Galaxies:</b> The highest amount of galaxies the galaxies autobuyer will buy. <br>
  <b>IP on crunch:</b> Once you break Infinity, you can set how many IP you would like to wait for before crunching. It accepts e notation (12.34e5 is 1234000). <br>
  <b>Sacrifice Autobuyer:</b> This autobuyer has a maxed timer from the start. You can set how much multiplier it waits for before sacrificing. It accepts e notation. <br>
  The double autobuyer tick speed upgrade will have all autobuyers buy twice as fast.<br>
    <b>Toggle All Autobuyers:</b> This button will turn all of your autobuyers on or off. <!--say how it decides which?--> <br>

  <button onclick='changestate(10)' id='div10btn' class="storebtn">Breaking Infinity</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div10' class='hidden'>
  Originally Antimatter Dimensions was restricted by "Infinity". Since a significant update, you can now "Break Infinity" once your Big Crunch autobuyer has been maxed. This opens up a selection of new upgrades as well as the ability to gain more than 1 infinity point per run. <br>
  <b>Fixing Infinity:</b>You can revert the breaking at anytime by clicking fix infinity. <br>
  <b>IP Gain Formula:</b>10^(log(current antimatter)/n-0.75)*bonuses, where n is 308 at default, 307.8 with the "This achievement doesn't exist II" achievement, or 290 with the relevant timestudy.

  <button onclick='changestate(11)' id='div11btn' class="storebtn">Infinity Dimensions</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div11' class='hidden'>
  <b>Unlocking Infinity Dimensions:</b>Infinity Dimensions are unlocked by reaching a certain amount of antimatter. <br>
  <b>Infinity Dimension Cost:</b>Infinity dimensions are only purchasable in sets of 10, and cost Infinity points. <br>
  <b>Infinity Dimension Production:</b>Similar to the original dimensions, each infinity dimension produces the dimension above it. Dimension 3 produce 2, 2 produces 1.  Instead of antimatter, Infinity Dimension produces Infinity power, which translates to an overall multiplier on all original dimensions. <br>
  Infinity Power gives a boost to all dimensions equal to (power^7).

  <hr id='div11hr'>
  <button onclick='changestate(12)' id='div12btn' class="storebtn">Infinity Challenges</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div12' class='hidden'>
  Infinity Challenges are like regular challenges, but they have higher end goals and are generally harder than regular challenges (but have a different kind of reward). <br>
  They unlock at set amounts of antimatter - the ones unlocking later are (generally) more difficult.
  </div>
  <hr id='div12hr'>
  <button onclick='changestate(13)' id='div13btn' class="storebtn">Replicanti</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div13' class='hidden'>
  Each replicanti has an upgradable chance to update every replicanti tick. You will gain a bonus to infinity dimensions based on much replicanti you have. <br>
  When replicanti reach infinity, you can buy a galaxy. This will not increase the cost of normal galaxies. The amount of replicanti galaxies you can have is capped (upgradable). Once you reach infinity replicanti, they will not continue growing. <br>
  When offline, in an inactive tab, lagging, or a tickspeed under 50ms, replicanti get calculated with an approximation. This can cause wildly varying results, especially at extremely low numbers (1-5). <br>
  When at low values (100-1000) (when none of the conditions above are true), there may be some minor variances in the expected amount of replicanti gain. <br>
    <b>Formulas: <br>
    Infinity Dimension power increase:</b> log2(replicanti)^2, plus replicanti^0.032 if you have the relevant time study, times 5^galaxies if you have that time study. <br>
    <b>Chance upgrade cost:</b>x(1e15) per upgrade <br>
    <b>Speed upgrade cost:</b>x(1e10) per upgrade <br>
    <b>Galaxy upgrade cost:</b>1e(170+n*25+n^2*5)

  Eternity

  <button onclick='changestate(14)' id='div14btn' class="storebtn">Eternity</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div14' class='hidden'>
  Upon reaching infinity Infinity Points, you can eternity. Eternities will reset everything before this point except challenge times, achievements, and total antimatter. You also unlock a new tab. <br>
  You can pass infinity Infinity Points whenever. You will recieve more Eternity Points the nore Infinity Points you had before going Eternal. <br>
  <b>EP gain formula:</b> floor(5^(floor(log10(IP))/308-0.7)*bonuses. The x10 EP time study gives the bonus before the outer floor.

  <hr id='div14hr'>
  <button onclick='changestate(15)' id='div15btn' class="storebtn">Milestones</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div15' class='hidden'>
    To make eternities faster and more convenient, you will unlock various buffs as you get more eternities. These buffs are either making you start with something on eternity or unlock an autobuyer. <br>
    For the buffs at the the start of an eternity, you will keep the relevant statistic on the run you unlock the milestone. (On 1 > 2, you will keep your autobuyers.) <br>
    The last milestone is at 100 eternities and allows full automation.
    </div>
    <hr id='div15hr'>
    <button onclick='changestate(16)'id='div16btn' class="storebtn">Time Dimensions</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div16' class='hidden'>
    After your first eternity, you unlock Time Dimensions. You buy them with EP and they provide time shards, which give free tickspeed upgrades (which don't increase the price). These free tickspeed upgrades stay on infinity (applying retroactively to your tickspeed mult through more galaxies). <br>
    Similarly to the other dimensions, a Time Dimension 2 produces a Time Dimension 1 and so on. <br>
    Each tick threshold takes 33% more time shards than the previous (25% with the relevant time study).
    </div>
    <hr id='div16hr'>
  <button onclick='changestate(17)' id='div17btn' class="storebtn">Time Study</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div17' class='hidden'>
    A Time Study is a powerful post-eternity upgrade, which costs Time Theorems. Time Studies are laid out in a tree-like fashion, where you must buy preresiquites before continuing. There are sometimes choices to make with which Time Study to buy, as you cannot get all of them even if affordable. <br>
    Time Theorems are a limited resource which costs more for each one you buy. They can be bought with antimatter, infinity points, and eternity points. <br>
    <b>Respecs:</b> A Respec allows you to reset the upgrades you have in the tree to retreive the Time Theorems spent on them. It can be done for free on eternity. <br>
    <b>Costs:</b> <br>
    <b>Antimatter:</b> 1e20000^times bought <br>
    <b>Infinity Points:</b> 1e100^times bought <br>
    <b>Eternity Points:</b> 2^times bought

    <div style="text-align: left" id='div18' class="hidden">
      Eternity Challenges are another set of challenges which are unlocked by the Time Study tree. They require a certain amount of Time Theorems to enter, plus a secondary requirement. <br>
      You can only complete each Eternity Challenge five times, and each time the rewards scale. <br>
      You do not need to have the Eternity Challenge unlocked for the reward to take effect. <br>
      There are a total of twelve Eternity Challenges, and each one introduces another item into the gameplay designed to make it harder. <br>
      The goals are in Infinity Points.

    <button onclick='changestate(19)' id='div19btn' class="storebtn">Time Dilation</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div19' class="hidden"> 
    Time dilation is unlocked when you purchase the 5,000 TT time study after beating both EC11 and EC12 five times, and after acquiring a total of 13,000 TT. Dilating time will start a new eternity, and all of your Dimension/Infinity/Time Dimension multipliers’ exponents and the tickspeed multipliers’ exponent will be reduced to ^0.75. <br>
      If you can reach 1.79e308 IP and eternity within a dilated eternity, you are rewarded with Tachyon Particles upon the dilated eternity. You can dilate as many times as you want. <br>
    Tachyon Particles generate another currency, Dilated Time. Dilated Time is translated into free galaxies by reaching a certain threshold. These galaxies are permanent except when you buy a certain Dilation Upgrade. <br>
    Dilation Upgrades are upgrades that are purchasable with Dilated Time. Some upgrades improve the amount of Dilated Time you gain or reset your free galaxies but decrease the threshold required to get to them. In addition, there is also a TT generator as one of the Dilation upgrades. The first row of dilation upgrades can be purchased any number of times, but the rest cannot.

<button onclick='changestate(20)' id='div20btn' class="storebtn">Reality</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div20' class="hidden">
     Reality is unlocked when you reach 5 billion time theorems and 1e4000 EP. Unlocking it opens a new tab. <br>
    Under this new tab, you can find the button to make a new Reality. You can either click it immediatly after unlocking it, or wait to obtain a higher glyph level and more Reality Machines. <br>
    Making a new Reality gives you a new currency known as Reality Machines, a glyph, and a perk point. Reality Machines can be spent on different upgrades throughout the Reality tab, such as Black Hole boosts, Reality Upgrades, and Automator commands. A glyph is an equippable item that can have multiple types. Each type has four effects. A perk point is a currency that can be spent in the Perks subtab on different Perks. <br><br>

      Each glyph can have up to 4 effects at once. You can find the full glyph effect list and their corresponding type <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/TyQbs4vX">here</a><br>
      When you reach 1,500 RM, have a total of 30 glyphs, and have bought the Reality upgrade, you unlock "Glyph Sacrificing". You can now sacrifice power and time glyphs for boosts to parts of the game corresponding to that glyph type.<br>
      At 100,000 RM, you unlock the ability to sacrifice all glyph types.<br>
      To sacrifice a glyph, simply shift+click on top of a glyph. This should create a pop-up that confirms if you want to sacrifice it. To speed up the sacrificing process, ctrl+shift+click to skip the confirmation.<br>

        Perks are a type of upgrade unlocked upon Reality. Each perk effect varies, but most are QoL (quality of life) improvements. All perks only require 1 perk point to buy. <br>
        Each Reality you gain 1 perk point which can be spent on a upgrade on the tree, starting with "You can now choose from 3 glyphs on reality". <br>

      There are unlocks within each Celestial's screen that you can unlock, usually before unlocking the Celestial itself, but there are also unlocks after.<br>

      <button onclick='changestate(251)' id='div251btn' class="storebtn">Teresa, Celestial of Reality</button>   
      <div style="text-align: left" id='div251' class="hidden">
        Teresa is the first Celestial. It is unlocked by obtaining all of the Reality Upgrades.<br>
        On the main screen, you see a bar with a button above it that says "Pour RM". This allows you to put your RM into the container for a Reality Machine multiplier.<br>
        The container loses RM over time, which means that the RM multiplier decreases over time.<br>
        When you reach 1e14 RM inside of the container, you permanately unlock Teresa's Reality. In game, it is described as the following:<br>
        <div style="text-align: center">
        <i>"Start Teresa's Reality. Glyph TT generation is disabled and you gain less IP and EP (x^0.6). The more antimatter you reach, the better the reward."</i>
        </div>
        The reward for beating Teresa is multiplying the power gained from glyph sacrifices.<br>
        At 1e18 RM, you unlock Teresa's Eternity Point generator. This works like Time Study 181, in the sense that you gain 1% of your peaked EP/Min per second.<br>
        Once you are at 1e21 RM in the container, you unlock Effarig, the second Celestial. As a side unlock, Teresa's container stops leaking RM.<br>
        Teresa's final unlock is at 1e24 RM, at which you unlock the Perk Shop, where you can spend spare Perk points on three upgrades that boost effeciency. 
      </div>
      <hr id='div251hr'>
      <button onclick='changestate(252)' id='div252btn' class="storebtn">Effarig, Celestial of Ancient Relics</button>   
      <div style="text-align: left" id='div252' class="hidden">
        Effarig is the second Celestial you encounter. It is unlocked by Teresa at 1e21 RM.<br>
        Effarig introduces a currency called Relic Shards, which are obtained by using different kinds of glyph effects and EP. This is the currency for Effarig's unlocks.<br>
        You can buy the first unlock, called Glyph level Adjustment, at 1e7 Relic Shards. This allows you to change the power of the resources that are taken into account for during the glyph level equation.<br>
        Next, at 2e8 RS, you can buy the next unlock, Automatic Glyph Sacrifice. This does exactly what you'd expect it to: sacrifice your glyphs. This checks, on an automatic reality (not a manual reality), if it fits within your requirements.<br>
        At 3e9 RS, the third unlock, the Automatic Glyph Picker, is unlocked. You can configure it to do what it has been doing every time (random), to pick the rarest glyph, or to pick the farthest above Advanced Mode's (auto sacrifice setting) thresholds.<br>
        Effarig's final unlock is of his own Reality at 5e11 RS. His Reality is divided into three sections: Infinity, Eternity, and Reality. His Reality's description in game is:<br>
        <div style="text-align: center">
        <i>"Start Effarig's Reality; all production, gamespeed, and tickspeed are severely lowered, infinity power reduces the production and gamespeed penalties and time shards reduce the tickspeed penalty. Glyph levels are temporarily capped."</i>
        </div>
        Each tier of his reality has different rewards. Some are to help during his Reality, and others are there to help outside. The main rewards are for Eternity and Reality.<br>
        His Eternity unlocks the next Celestial, The Enslaved Ones. It also allows Eternities to generate Infinities, and disables the Infinity Point multiplier cap in his Reality.<br>
        Completing his Reality unlocks a new mechanic known as <font color="#e21717">Effarig</font> Glyphs. These are a new Glyph type.<br>
        On an Effarig Glyph, you have an equal chance of getting each effect. There are 7 different possible effects on an Effarig Glyph, which can be found <a href="https://pastebin.com/992cYUY3">here.</a><br>
        You can only have one Effarig glyph equipped at a time.

        <button onclick='changestate(253)' id='div253btn' class="storebtn">The Enslaved Ones</button>   
      <div style="text-align: left" id='div253' class="hidden">
        The Enslaved Ones are the third Celestial, unlocked at Effarig's Eternity.<br>
        The interface for The Enslaved Ones has a few buttons on it. The top left button should say <i>"0.000 seconds"</i>, and then <i>"Store black hole time"</i>. This button allows you to store the time that you are advancing through due to your black hole. The button directly below it allows you to use the time you are storing through the black hole.<br>
        To store black hole time, simply click on the "store black hole time" button. This should initiate the timer at the top. To use stored black hole time, click the button below.<br>
        On the right hand side, there are another two buttons. The top right button isn't actually a button. It is used to display info about the amount of <i><b>REAL</b></i> time you have stored, not black hole time. The button below is the real time storage settings. By default, it says "Offline time used for production", but clicking on it toggles the other setting: "Offline time stored". This allows you to switch between storing your offline time at a 33% effeciency by default, and using offline time for producing Antimatter and other resources.<br>
        To use stored real time, go to the Reality screen, and look under the Glyphs tab. There should be a button that says <i>"Amplify using stored real time"</i>, with a number next to it. If you click the button, it should change to a yellow color. Now, upon Reality, you will get ×x Glyphs, Realities, and RM.<br>
        Amplifying a reality in this way effectively uses your real time to complete that particular reality over and over, so you should try to be quick in order to increase the number of times its repeated.<br>
        Purchasing any of The Enslaved Ones unlocks required having years saved up in stored Black Hole time.<br>
        Their first unlock is for 1e35 years, which increases the free tickspeed softcap by 100,000 upgrades.<br>
        Soon after, at 1e40 years, you are able to finally unlock their Reality, which is described as:<br>
        <div style="text-align: center">
        <i>"Start Enslaved Ones Reality. ID, TD, and 8th dimension purchases are limited to 1 each, Normal dimension multipliers are always dilated (the glyph effect still only applies in actual dilation), Time study 192 is locked, The black hole is disabled, Tachyon production and dilated time production are severely reduced, Time theorem generation from dilation glyphs is much slower, Certain challenge goals have been increased, and Stored time is much less effective."</i>
        </div>
        In their Reality, it has some aspects about it that make it seem like a puzzle. There are clues throughout a few different pages of the game.<br>
        The reward for defeating The Enslaved Ones is that the Infinity Dimension purchase caps are increased by 1000 for every 1000 free tickspeed upgrades.<br>

        <hr id='div253hr'>
        <button onclick='changestate(254)' id='div254btn' class="storebtn">V, Celestial of Achievements</button>   
        <div style="text-align: left" id='div254' class="hidden">
          V is a special Celestial in the sense that it is not unlocked by another Celestial, but by an achievement. She is unlocked by completing achievement r151 (row 15, column 1, "You really didn't need it anyway") which requires you to get 800 Antimatter Galaxies without buying 8th Dimensions in your current infinity.<br>
          After being unlocked, you are met with another set of requirements to fully unlock V. You are required to reach 1e4 (10,000) Realities, 1e70 Eternities, 1e160 Infinities, 1e320 Dilated Time, and 1e320,000 Replicanti, all in the same run.<br>
          When you meet those requirements, you are now in the V interface. On the screen, you should see six white hexagons surrounding one orange hexagon. The six white hexagons represent what are known as "V-achievements", which are unlocked by reaching their requirements inside of V's Reality. The orange hexagon in the middle is the button to enter into the Reality, which contains the nerfs to V's reality, which are as follows:<br>
          <div style="text-align: center">
          <i>"Start V's Reality. All dimension multipliers, EP gain, IP gain, and dilated time gain per second are square-rooted, and Replicanti interval is squared."</i>
          </div>
          When you reach the requirements for a V-Achievement in her Reality, you are awarded with that achievement. V-achievements go to two different things: unlocking rewards and being able to add more studies to your tree.<br>
          V has three rewards unlockable with the V-Achievements. The first one requires you to have ten V-Achievements, and increases the speed of the Auto-EC perk by your Achievement multiplier.<br>
          The second unlockable needs thirty V-Achievements to unlock, and it multiplies black hole power by your achievement count. It also unlocks Ra, the next Celestial.<br>
          The final unlockable takes all thirty-six V-Achievements to unlock, and doubles the amount of locked studies you can buy.<br>
          One of V's passive unlocks is the ability to buy studies that you are not normally able to buy. This requires six (three with the final unlock) V-Achievements to be completed to buy one locked study.<br>
