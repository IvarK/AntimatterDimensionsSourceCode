      The first row of upgrades can be purchased endlessly, but get expensive more quickly above {{ format(1e30) }} RM
      and {{ format(maxNumber, 1) }} RM.
      <br>
      The rest of the upgrades are one-time upgrades which have an unlocking requirement in addition to an RM cost.
      <br>
      These requirements, once completed, permanently unlock the ability to purchase the upgrades at any point.
      <br>
      Each complete row of purchased upgrades adds {{ formatInt(1) }} to your glyph level.
      <br>
      Red upgrades are impossible to unlock this Reality, while yellow upgrades are still possible.
      <br>
      Locked upgrades show their requirement and effect by default; unlocked ones show
      their effect, current bonus, and cost.
