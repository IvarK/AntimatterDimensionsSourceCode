    info: `
All of the previous patches since "The Reality Update" have been with the goal of fixing commonly reported bugs and
implementing highly suggested features. However, this patch is planned to be the final official patch. There may be
a few minor patches from bugs/requests in response to this set of changes, but these will likely be fixed or added
as they come in. We may try to add more beyond that, but this is no longer a guarantee and future changes will
probably not have their own changelog entries.

amongst those 4 choices.

<li>Time dimension prices now have 2 decimal places.</li>
<li>Reformatted the tick interval reduction text for very small numbers.</li>
<li>The game now keeps track of when you automatically do an infinity, and you can passively gain IP based off the
IP/min in that run if you go offline (but only if infinity isn't broken).</li>
<li>Made time study 171 apply retroactively. This was causing an issue with production being much lower than expected
when going into a long run on the same run as respeccing.</li>

wasn't hiding correctly upon import.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where buy max dim boosts was able to buy 1 too many boosts.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the study tree would be off-centered if the game windows wasn't wide enough.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could buy factions of dimension boosts with dimension boost bulk buy.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where your autobuy max dimension boost interval would set itself to itself
if you eternitied while changing it.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where secondary statistic tabs weren't hiding upon import.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where replicanti galaxies wouldn't give a bonus if you had less than 3 galaxies.</li>
