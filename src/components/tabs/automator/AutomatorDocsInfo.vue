    This page of the Automator pane shows information about the scripting language used for the Automator.

    If you feel confident about diving right in to making your own script, you can open up a list of command
    documentation pages. This will be similarly formatted to reference pages for programming.

    If you have minimal or no prior coding experience, or do not feel like writing your own code, you can
    instead use some premade templates which generate text that can put directly into the Automator text field.
