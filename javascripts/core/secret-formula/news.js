      "So I've pondered this question for a long time. Antimatter Dimensions... what does it mean? I mean it's a " +
      "game, that's clear. You buy the first dimension, and it gives you antimatter, and the second dimension " +
      "provides more first dimensions and so on... But what does it mean? It can't just be a game, it seems too " +
      "plain for that. The developer must have made it as a metaphor. I was doing my weekly ritual of using the " +
      "fingernail clipper to cut my pubic hair, when finally the realization came to me. The dimensions are just " +
      "thinly veiled misspellings of the word 'depression'. Regular matter are the cruel and negative thoughts that " +
      "add to and fuel depression, while antimatter is the positive thoughts and good friends that dispel it. You " +
      "start off with something simple, and it fights almost imperceptibly against the depression, but as you keep " +
      "going the fight builds. But it never seems to fix everything. The depression seems like it could go on to " +
      "infinity. So you keep going. But eventually, you figure out, depression isn't infinite. It's just very very " +
      "large. But your 'dimensions' eventually, with enough work, make enough 'antimatter' to usurp that seeming " +
      "infinity of depression. Then the possibilities are endless. You are actually happy for once, and your " +
      "happiness grows exponentially as you go beyond and seemingly 'break' the 'infinity' of depression. And you " +
      "go on until that 'infinity' seems tiny in comparison to the happiness you've managed to achieve in your " +
      "life, where if you reset you get over that infinity in less than the blink of an eye. If you want to know " +
      "what the multiple layers of prestige are...'Dimensional Shifts' are getting new things and methods to give " +
      "you happiness. 'Dimension Boosts' are upgrading the things and methods. Examples would be getting a new car " +
      "being a 'Dimensional Shift' and trading that car in for a new one would be a 'Dimension Boost'. 'Eternities' " +
      "are major tragedies such as a loved one dying. That lapse brings you straight back to the beginning, with " +
      "seemingly no hope of return. But with time, you grow back stronger and happier than ever before. 'Dimensional " +
      "Sacrifice' is moving away. You have to give up a lot of the things you had that made you happy, but there is " +
      "new opportunity in where you move to. And that new opportunity gives you more happiness than you ever had. " +
