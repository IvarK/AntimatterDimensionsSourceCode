Dimensions are your production units in game. The first Dimension produces your antimatter.
Each consecutive Dimension produces the previous one, allowing you to have steady growth.
There are eight Dimensions total.
<br>
<br>
<b>Dimension Multiplier:</b> Beside the Dimension there is a multiplier (example: First Dimension ${formatX(1, 1, 1)}).
The base production of each Dimension is multiplied by this number.
This multiplier increases by ${formatX(2)} for every ${formatInt(10)} of that Dimension purchased.
Each time this occurs, the price of the dimension will increase.
<br>
<br>
<b>Accumulated Dimension Quantity:</b> The next column is your current amount of that Dimension you own.
This is a combination of how many you have purchased with antimatter,
as well as produced from the higher Dimension.
<br>
<br>
<b>Purchased Dimensions Quantity:</b> Next to each accumulated quantity of owned Dimensions,
the amount of that Dimension purchased toward the next multiplier upgrade is displayed in brackets.
For example if you have (${formatInt(4)}) next to your accumulated dimension quantity,
you will need ${formatInt(6)} more of that dimension for the next multiplier increase.
<br>
<br>
<b>Dimension Growth Percent:</b> This number represents the amount of growth that each
Dimension experiences per second. ${formatPercents(1)} means the dimension is doubling each second.
This allows you to judge overall growth.
<br>
<br>
<b>Cost &amp; until ${formatInt(10)}:</b>
You can buy a single quantity of each Dimension with antimatter when the cost button is highlighted.
Alternatively, if the Until ${formatInt(10)} button is highlighted,
you can buy whatever quantity gets you to that Dimension's next Dimension multiplier.

Time Dilation is unlocked when you purchase the ${formatInt(5000)} TT time study after
beating both EC11 and EC12 five times, and after acquiring a total of ${formatInt(13000)} TT.
Dilating time will start a modified Eternity, called Time Dilation, in which all of your Antimatter/Infinity/Time
Dimension multipliers’ <i>exponents</i> and the Tickspeed multipliers’ <i>exponent</i> will raised to the power of
${format(0.75, 2, 2)}, significantly reducing them.
<br>
<br>
If you can reach ${formatPostBreak(Number.MAX_VALUE, 2)} IP and then complete the Eternity while Dilated, you will be
rewarded with Tachyon Particles. You can dilate as many times as you want, but Tachyon Particles cannot be "farmed" like
other resources. Instead, you can only gain more Tachyon Particles by passing your previous highest antimatter within
Time Dilation, and you will only gain more based on your <i>new</i> highest antimatter from this new run.
<br>
<br>
Tachyon Particles generate another currency called Dilated Time. Dilated Time is translated into Tachyon Galaxies by
reaching thresholds similarly to the Tickspeed upgrades gained from Time Dimensions. These Tachyon Galaxies are like
Replicanti Galaxies in that they affect Tickspeed as if they were Antimatter Galaxies but they don't increase the cost
of your next Antimatter Galaxy.
<br>
<br>
Unlocking Time Dilation also unlocks upgrades you can purchase using Dilated Time. The first row of Dilation upgrades
can be repeatedly purchased as many times as you can afford them.

When you reach ${format(5e9)} time theorems, ${formatPostBreak(new Decimal("1e4000"))} EP, and have completed the first
${formatInt(13)} rows of Achievements, you will be able to purchase the Time Study that unlocks Reality.
Unlocking it opens a new tab, where you can find the button to make a new Reality. Starting a new Reality
will reset everything you have done so far except challenge times and total antimatter, but in exchange gives
you a new currency known as Reality Machines, a Glyph, and a Perk Point.
<br>
<br>
Unlike the other resets so far, you also lose the first ${formatInt(13)} rows of Achievements - that is, all of
the pre-Reality Achievements and all of their associated rewards. You need to re-do them in order to get their
rewards again, but you will also passively unlock the next incomplete Achievement every half hour without any
effort even if you otherwise don't have the requirements to do so. This also happens offline at the same rate.
<br>
<br>
Reality Machines can be spent on different upgrades throughout the Reality tab and are your primary currency from this
point onwards. Glyphs are equippable objects which you must equip in order to use their boosts. Perk points are another
currency that can be spent in the Perks subtab on different Perks.
<br>
<br>
Reality Machines scale purely off of EP, and the Reality button will tell you how much EP you need in order to gain
the next one. The first ${formatInt(10)} RM scale linearly in the exponent between
${formatPostBreak(new Decimal("1e4000"))} EP and ${formatPostBreak(Decimal.pow(10, 16000 / 3))} EP, and then past that

A Glyph is an equippable object that has four attributes:
<br>
Type - This is a name given to the Glyph based on what part of the game it will tend to boost (eg. "Glyph of X"). This
determines the possible effects it may have.
<br>
Level - This contributes to how strong your Glyph is, and it scales based on how well you did in the Reality you got
it from.
<br>
Rarity - This is a percentage, between ${formatPercents(0)} and ${formatPercents(1)}, which also affects the strength
of your Glyph. This is random, but can be influenced by various upgrades.
<br>
Effects - These are the boosts that equipping the Glyph will give you, and can contain up to four effects. Stronger
Glyphs will generally have more effects than weaker Glyphs.
<br>
<b>Note: Your first Glyph will have a fixed effect and rarity, but its level will scale based on your progress before
any Reality content. Once you receive a Glyph, its attributes can't be changed.</b>
<br>
<br>
To equip a Glyph, drag the icon from your inventory into one of the active circles in the middle of the screen. If
you equipped the glyph properly, the effect list to the right should change and the Glyph icon should now be circular.
Active Glyphs can't be unequipped or swapped with other Glyphs without restarting your current Reality, but you can
equip Glyphs into <i>empty</i> active slots at any time during a Reality.
<br>
<br>
The slots in the first rows of your inventory are "protected" slots. New glyphs will never be placed into them (even if
there is no more room in your inventory), and they are unaffected by the Sort and Auto clean buttons.
<br>
<br>
You can delete Glyphs from your inventory by shift-clicking them, which will prompt you with a confirmation dialog
asking if you are sure you want to delete the Glyph. Holding shift and ctrl together while clicking will bypass this
dialog. <b>However, deleting Glyphs will give you no benefit beyond clearing up inventory space if you do so before

      name: "Black Hole",
      info: () => `
The Black Hole is a feature which speeds up how fast the game runs, on a periodic cycle.
The game will run at normal speed for some amount of time, then have a burst of running extremely fast for a short
period of time before going back to normal speed and repeating the cycle.
<br>
<br>
Increased game speed from Black Holes is much stronger than tickspeed because unlike tickspeed, it affects
<i>everything equally</i>, including things which are only partially affected (eg. Infinity/Time Dimensions), things
which are normally completely unaffected (eg. DT/TT generation), and effects which are boosted purely on time spent
(eg. idle path IP/EP multipliers).
<br>
<br>
You can buy upgrades for the Black Hole by using Reality Machines. There are three upgrades for the Black Hole:
<br>
Interval - How long the Black Hole is inactive between bursts,
reduced by ${formatPercents(0.2)} per upgrade.
<br>
Power - How much faster the game runs during the temporary speed bursts,
increased by ${formatPercents(0.35)} per upgrade.
<br>
Duration - How long each speed burst lasts before going back to normal speed,
increased by ${formatPercents(0.3)} per upgrade.
<br>
<br>
Once you reach ${formatInt(1)} year of game playtime, you unlock a Reality upgrade that allows you to have
a second Black Hole. The time spent for this requirement is itself affected by the first Black Hole, so it
takes much less than ${formatInt(1)} actual real-time year.
<br>
<br>
Once the Black Hole is active at least ${formatPercents(0.9999, 2)} of the time, it becomes permanently active.
This is tracked separately for the two Black Holes.
<br>
<br>
The timer on the second Black Hole only advances when the first Black Hole is active. So, for example, if the first
Black Hole has a duration of ${formatInt(4)} minutes and the second has an interval of ${formatInt(8)} minutes, the
second Black Hole will only activate once every two cycles of the first Black Hole regardless of how short the
first Black Hole's interval is. Note that the timer shown in the in-game header takes account of this and shows
the actual time until the second Black Hole activates; in the Black Hole tab, you can see the amount of time with
the first Black Hole active needed for the second Black Hole to activate.
<br>
<br>
The Black Holes can be paused, completely halting their interval/duration cycle. However, when unpausing them, it will
take ${BlackHoles.ACCELERATION_TIME} real-time seconds for them to reach maximum speed if they were paused while their
speed boost was active. Pausing and unpausing affects both Black Holes; they can't be paused or unpaused independently.

Automatic Glyph Filtering is purchaseable for ${format(GameDatabase.celestials.effarig.unlocks.basicFilter.cost)}
Relic Shards. This system uses one of many methods to assign a score to your glyph choices, and then picks the choice
with the highest score. After picking this glyph, it checks the score against a threshold and either keeps it if the
score is above the threshold, or sacrifices it instead. Initially there are three modes:
<br>
<b>Lowest total sacrifice</b> - Glyphs are given a score based on how much sacrifice value you have of that
particular glyph's type. Glyphs of the type you have the least sacrifice value in will have the highest score.
This mode doesn't have a threshold and always sacrifices your glyphs.
<br>
<b>Number of effects</b> - Glyphs are given a score equal to the number of effects they have, and when multiple
glyphs have the same effect count, glyphs with higher rarity will be picked. The threshold they are
compared to is specified by your input in the text box.
<br>
<b>Rarity Threshold Mode</b> - Glyphs are given a score equal to their rarity percent. The comparison threshold
can be set individually per glyph type.
<br>
<br>
For ${format(GameDatabase.celestials.effarig.unlocks.advancedFilter.cost)} Relic Shards, you can unlock two more modes
with some additional flexibility:
<br>
<b>Specified Effect Mode</b> - Glyphs are given a score equal to their rarity and checked against the rarity threshold
you specify, but this score is modified based on your inputs for effects. The Glyph will be checked for having a minimum
number of effects and having all of the effects you choose, and its score is lowered by ${formatInt(200)} for every
missing effect. This guarantees that any glyph that doesn't have the effects you want will be below the threshold.
<br>
<b>Advanced Mode</b> - This mode is like Specified Effect Mode, but you have even finer control over the effects of
your Glyphs. The score of a Glyph is calculated from its rarity plus the score of each effect it has, and you can set
the threshold to any value you want. One possible way you can use this behavior is to give a weaker effect a value of
${formatInt(5)}, which allows you to keep Glyphs without that effect as long as they are rarer.
<br>
<br>
<i>Note: If desired, "Specified Effect Mode" and "Advanced Mode" can be used to filter out some Glyph types entirely;
for example setting impossible conditions like "at least ${formatInt(6)} effects" or "Minimum score ${formatInt(999)}
and all effects worth ${formatInt(0)}" on Power Glyphs will make it so that a Power Glyph is never picked.</i>

The Enslaved Ones are the third Celestial, unlocked by completing Effarig's Eternity.

When unlocking The Enslaved Ones, you immediately gain access to two new mechanics related to time. You can store
"game time" by charging your Black Hole, and you can store "real time" by intentionally halting your production.
Stored game time is also used as a currency for purchasing unlocks from The Enslaved Ones.
<br>
<br>
Charging your Black Hole gives you stored time, which it does at the expense of setting your game speed to
${formatInt(1)}. The game is in effect using your increased game speed in order to store time itself. Its
main use is to discharge the Black Hole, which takes uses your stored time to skip forward in time by a duration
equal to the time stored. This is different than regular game speed multipliers in that discharging is not subject to
any modifiers to game speed when it is used, only when it is stored.
<br>
<br>
Storing real time completely stops all production, effectively pausing your game. For every real-time second that
passes, you gain stored real time (modified by some efficiency factor). You can use stored real time in order to
amplify a Reality in the Glyphs tab. This uses all of your stored real time at once in order to attempt to repeat that
exact Reality over and over, giving you all the rewards you would normally get from the repetitions. For example, if
you have ${formatInt(50)} minutes stored and amplify a Reality which has lasted ${formatInt(10)} minutes and would
give ${format(1e30)} RM and ${format(1e12)} Relic Shards, the amplified Reality will give you ${format(5e30)} RM,

Glyph Alchemy is a mechanic unlocked by reaching Effarig level ${formatInt(2)} in Ra. It unlocks the ability to
use up your glyphs by refining them into alchemy resources associated with their type. Each resource gives some
kind of a boost to certain parts of the game based on how much of them you have.
<br>
<br>
The amount of a resource you get from a glyph is based on the cube of the glyph's level, scaled so that level
${formatInt(10000)} glyphs correspond to ${formatInt(10000)} alchemy resources. A single glyph itself,
however, only gives ${formatPercents(GlyphSacrificeHandler.glyphRefinementEfficiency)} of this maximum value, and
also can't give you more resources than the cap. This cap is applied per glyph, and you will never lose resources
when you try to refine a glyph.
<br>
(This calculation applies for perfect ${formatPercents(1)}
rarity glyphs. Glyphs of lesser rarity still have the same cap, but give less resources.)
<br>
<br>
As an example of how the cap works, a level ${formatInt(10000)} glyph is worth
${formatInt(10000 * GlyphSacrificeHandler.glyphRefinementEfficiency)} resources normally, but will be worth less if you
already have at least ${formatInt(10000 * (1 - GlyphSacrificeHandler.glyphRefinementEfficiency))} of that resource
(bringing you up to a maximum of ${formatInt(10000)} after refinement). The glyph is worth nothing at all if you
already have ${formatInt(10000)} resources or more, as that is the cap for level ${formatInt(10000)} glyphs.
<br>
<br>
Alchemy resources can be combined together in certain combinations in order to create new compound resources, which
are unlocked at certain Effarig levels. Resources are combined once per Reality, unaffected by real time
amplification. The amount of compound resources you can have after a reaction is limited to the amount of the reagents
that go into it, which means all of your resources are ultimately limited by your glyph level.
<br>
<br>
To activate or deactivate a reaction, click the circle corresponding to the reaction's product. When the reaction can
be applied, moving lines will be shown from all reagents to the product. If a connection is a solid line, that means
that the reaction can't proceed due to not having enough of that reagent to get more of the product due to its cap.

Lai'tela is the sixth Celestial, unlocked by having a level ${formatInt(25000)} Reality Glyph,
a total of ${formatInt(100)} Ra levels, and spending ${formatPostBreak(new Decimal("1e2000"))} Reality Machines.
<br>
<br>
When you unlock Lai'tela, your Antimatter Dimensions and Tickspeed upgrades switch to a new mode of production
called Continuum, which gives the same effect as previously but allows for buying fractions of dimensions or
Tickspeed upgrades. Additionally, these fractional purchases are given for free without spending your antimatter.
This makes your autobuyers for Antimatter Dimensions obsolete, which is noted on the autobuyers page.
<br>
<br>
Lai'tela gives a new currency called Dark Matter, which gives a multiplier to purchases of dimensions and Tickspeed
upgrades from Continuum based on the highest amount of Dark Matter you have ever had. Dark Matter is produced by
Dark Matter Dimensions, in a similar way to all other types of dimensions in the game. There are four Dark Matter
Dimensions; you start with the first one unlocked immediately and the higher ones are unlocked at increasing amounts
of Dark Matter. When unlocking dimensions, you are given ${formatInt(1)} of the dimension and cannot gain more without
having it produced from the next tier up.
<br>
<br>
Each Dark Matter Dimension, after a certain interval of time, generates two things: Dark Matter or the next lower
Dark Matter Dimension and another currency called Dark Energy. Dark Matter and Dark Matter Dimension production
per interval is equal to the product of your Dark Matter multiplier and the number of dimensions you have, while
Dark Energy production is independent of your dimension amount. Dark Energy is used to produce Singularities, which
have their own How to Play entry.
<br>
<br>
Dark Matter Dimensions can have their intervals upgraded down to a minimum of ${formatInt(10)}ms, at which point
you cannot upgrade the interval any further. You can choose to ascend Dark Matter Dimensions which reach
that point, which multiplies Dark Matter and Dark Energy values for that Dimension by ${formatInt(1000)}. The interval
gets multiplied ${formatInt(10000)} (can be reduced with more progress in Lai'tela), but can be upgraded once again.
Reaching ${formatInt(10)}ms again allows you to ascend again if you choose to.
<br>
<br>
When you get ${format(Laitela.annihilationDMRequirement)} Dark Matter, you unlock a prestige called Annihilation.
Annihilation resets your Dark Matter, Dark Matter Dimensions, and Dark Energy, but adds to a permanent multiplier
to Dark Matter. You can Annihilate multiple times, the additions to the multiplier stack additively, and there is
no need to annihilate for a greater addition each time.
<br>
<br>
Lai'tela has a Reality which gives a multiplier to Dark Matter Dimensions' Dark Matter power based on how well you
do in the Reality.

Singularities are a new resource which you can obtain using features within Lai'tela.
<br>
<br>
In order to obtain Singularities, you need to reach ${format(2e3)} Dark Energy. When you do, you get the option to
condense all your Dark Energy into a Singularity, resetting it back to zero. Any extra Dark Energy above this amount
does not carry over, and is thus wasted. Note that only Dark Energy is reset, the status of your Dark Matter and its
dimensions stays the same when condensing Singularities.
<br>
<br>
At any point, you can freely increase or decrease the Dark Energy requirement to condense Singularities by a factor of
${formatInt(10)} (with a minimum of ${format(2e3)}). This increases or decreases the number of Singularities gained
from resetting at the cap by <i>more than</i> a factor of ${formatInt(10)}, making higher caps worth more if you
are willing to wait.
<br>
<br>
Reaching a certain number of Singularities will unlock Singularity milestones, which act similarly to Eternity
milestones. Unlocking these milestones simply requires you to reach the total number of Singularities specified.
There are three types of milestones - one-time milestones, milestones repeatable a limited number of times, and
milestones which can be repeated indefinitely. Additionally, milestones also have an icon indicating what kind of
upgrade they generally give:

<b>ᛝ</b> These milestones help mechanics specific to Lai'tela

<i class="fas fa-arrows-alt"></i> These milestones let a resource in Lai'tela affect the rest of the game
