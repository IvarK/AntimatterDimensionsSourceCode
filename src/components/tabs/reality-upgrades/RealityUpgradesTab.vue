    The first row of upgrades can be purchased endlessly, but costs increase much faster above {{ format(1e30) }}
    and {{ format(maxNumber, 1) }} Reality Machines.
    <br>
    The rest of the upgrades are one-time upgrades which have an unlocking requirement in addition
    to costing Reality Machines.
    <br>
    These requirements, once completed, permanently unlock the ability to purchase the upgrades at any point.
    <br>
    Red upgrades are impossible to unlock this Reality, while yellow upgrades are still possible.
    <br>
    Locked upgrades show their requirement and effect by default; unlocked ones show
    their effect, current bonus, and cost.
    <br>
    Hold shift to swap this behavior.
    <br>
    Every completed row of purchased upgrades increases your glyph level by {{ formatInt(1) }}.
