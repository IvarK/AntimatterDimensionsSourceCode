      "So I've pondered this question for a long time. Antimatter Dimensions... what does it mean? I mean it's a " +
      "game, that's clear. You buy the first dimension, and it gives you antimatter, and the second dimension " +
      "provides more first dimensions and so on... But what does it mean? It can't just be a game, it seems too " +
      "plain for that. The developer must have made it as a metaphor. I was doing my weekly ritual of using the " +
      "fingernail clipper to cut my pubic hair, when finally the realization came to me. The dimensions are just " +
      "thinly veiled misspellings of the word 'depression'. Regular matter are the cruel and negative thoughts that " +
      "add to and fuel depression, while antimatter is the positive thoughts and good friends that dispel it. You " +
      "start off with something simple, and it fights almost imperceptibly against the depression, but as you keep " +
      "going the fight builds. But it never seems to fix everything. The depression seems like it could go on to " +
      "infinity. So you keep going. But eventually, you figure out, depression isn't infinite. It's just very very " +
      "large. But your 'dimensions' eventually, with enough work, make enough 'antimatter' to usurp that seeming " +
      "infinity of depression. Then the possibilities are endless. You are actually happy for once, and your " +
      "happiness grows exponentially as you go beyond and seemingly 'break' the 'infinity' of depression. And you " +
      "go on until that 'infinity' seems tiny in comparison to the happiness you've managed to achieve in your " +
      "life, where if you reset you get over that infinity in less than the blink of an eye. If you want to know " +
      "what the multiple layers of prestige are...'Dimensional Shifts' are getting new things and methods to give " +
      "you happiness. 'Dimension Boosts' are upgrading the things and methods. Examples would be getting a new car " +
      "being a 'Dimensional Shift' and trading that car in for a new one would be a 'Dimension Boost'. 'Eternities' " +
      "are major tragedies such as a loved one dying. That lapse brings you straight back to the beginning, with " +
      "seemingly no hope of return. But with time, you grow back stronger and happier than ever before. 'Dimensional " +
      "Sacrifice' is moving away. You have to give up a lot of the things you had that made you happy, but there is " +
      "new opportunity in where you move to. And that new opportunity gives you more happiness than you ever had. " +

      "TJ \"Slabdrill\" Yoshi, hear me out. An M press actually has three parts to it: when M is pressed, when M is " +
      "held, and when M is released. Now, usually is the pressing that’s useful because that’s the only part that " +
      "matters; however, sometimes it’s sufficient to just use the holding part, which also buys dimensions and " +
      "tickspeed upgrades. And as for the release, well, there are currently no cases where that’s useful or " +
      "important, so don’t worry about that part. Now, if we map out the required presses for challenge 2 it would " +
      "look like this: /¯\\. We merely need to hold (¯) M to reach the first galaxy, we need to press (/) M to " +
      "finish the challenge, and we need to press M again to start another challenge. So, how many presses is that " +
      "total? Well, it appears to be three, and if we were doing this eternity in isolation then yes, it would be " +
      "three, but in a full-game M Button Challenge run there are other M presses that occur earlier in the run, " +
      "such as the M press needed for the first Infinity, so if we take that M press into consideration as well, " +
      "then how many M presses does it take? The naive answer would be four: one to enter the challenge, and the " +
      "three within the challenge we established earlier; however, we can do better. We can actually do it in " +
      "three by simply holding out the first M press to be used for the half M press, because the half M press only " +
      "required M to be held, not actually pressed, so in this fashion, Challenge 2 only adds on an additional two M " +
      "presses to the run, since the first M press just leeches off the previous M press. So to capture this " +
      "phenomenon, we call it 2.5 M presses. On a single Eternity basis, you’d round up that up to three, but in " +
      "a full game run, you’d round it down to two. So, in conclusion, since that first M press counts in other " +
