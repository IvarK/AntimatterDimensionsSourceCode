        Shift is a modifier key that shows additional information on certain things and
        adjusts the function of certain buttons.
        <br>
        You can hold shift while buying time studies to buy all up until that point,
        save study trees, cycle backwards through themes and notations, and delete glyphs.
        <br>
        Hotkeys do not work while holding control.
